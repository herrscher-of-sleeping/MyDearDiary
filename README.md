# My Dear Diary

Time logging tool that automatically uses git branch name as task name by default when you start a task.

It doesn't care about possible time zone changes and stuff, this may be a subject of further improvements.

But for now I just needed a tool that makes me bother as little as possible about typing task name every time I start working on a task.
